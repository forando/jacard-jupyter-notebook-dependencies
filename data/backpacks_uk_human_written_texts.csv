The distinctive models with the fox logo are nowadays more and more often seen in cities, especially if they are populated by many students, dominated like the Trunki Ride-on dominates kids at airports. Despite years of durability, the Swedish brand's ecological backpacks have only recently conquered everyday life in the UK.Fjällräven Re-Kånken: Sustainable as Heck This is the successor of the Kånken backpack, which is different in terms of the outer, inner and support material.

20,"Isobel - 29/04/15 The Kånken from Fjällräven is the brand's original rucksack, coexisting currently alongside several variants in the series, including mini, laptop and kids' versions.

Staying true to this, these bags have been ergonomically designed to help straighten out your back and comfortably manage a given load. Given it's narrow shoulder straps, it's advised against over packing as they would dig into the wearer. The straps themselves are of course adjustable to suit wearers' height and style. There is also a carrying strap for wear as a 'hip' tote bag when you feel a backpack isn't the thing for your setting.The backpack itself was conceived in 1978 and certainly has carried the 70's feel to it, popular amongst retro clothing sympathisers and those who like the history behind the rucksack. Their current unisex range is available in 27 unique colours with something to appeal to all tastes.The bag is designed with one large front zipper which conveniently opens up the entire front of the bag, giving full access to the contents within, making them easy to put in and take out. There are also two slim side pockets for quicker access to smaller items such as bottled water. The inside is compartmentalised into two pockets. The back pocket contains a removable sitting pad thin enough so as to not give the bag a bulky effect although thick enough to cushion the back whilst in place. As a seat it provides ample cushioning from any stones and bumps in the landscape you're sitting on.Classed as their everyday outdoor model, they are made from hard-wearing vinylon fabric, which is both water resistant, durable and lightweight too, containing no non textile parts of animal origin. With regards to care, it's advised against washing these daypacks, althought as an everyday bag they're not designed to be out in all terrain and exposed to excess mud and dust anyway.The Fjällräven logo complete with the model name Kånken and fox and moon motif appears on the front. Whilst being aesthetically pleasing this also doubles as a reflector. Albeit small, anything which reflects light is a safety feature, handy when walking at night or dimly lit areas.The Kånken is capable of holding up to 16 L and, weighing just 300 g, this is very much for everyday use with personal belongings. It's not large enough for a weekend away for example, with anything over 35 L more suited for that purpose. For those wishing for a smaller size, the Kånken Mini is available. Conversely, those looking for more storage space should consider the Kånken Big.To sum up, this is a great backpack for everyday use. The stylish commuter and student alike will appreciate the Swedish brand's iconic logo and cult retro style. On the negative side, functionality is a bit lost considering heavy items won't be supported well by slim straps, however, considering the bags size, it's not intended for use with a heavy load."

But their durability does not affect their comfort as the straps and back are heavily padded and distribute any load evenly.There are five main pockets and two side pockets, but this bag is a lot like a Russian doll as the more you open it up, the more pockets you'll discover.

62,"Swiss luggage and travel equipment manufacturer Wenger are renowned for quality products and its Gigabyte 15.4 inch laptop bag epitomises just that. The company that gave the world the Swiss Army Knife has produced a bag that is aimed at those who demand much more than merely something to carry basic items. On the face of it, the bag looks like something that could be used for sports, but in reality it is more for walkers and business users who need something well-made and durable.Its main selling point is that fact that it contains a padded slot for a 15.4 inch laptop finished with an anti-scratch lining. This makes carriage easy and comfortable, but also provides the protection all discerning computer users should demand. In front of that, there is another slot for a tablet or iPad. But that's not where your storage options end as there are a further three compartments. The first of these is a deep yet thin section that is ideal for documents and folders. To the front of that is a smaller section that can be used for carrying small handheld devices such as iPods or even a mobile phone. And at the very front is another pocket for all your knick knacks. The side of the backpack features a zipped pocket for a water bottle, but it can also be used to store foldable overhead headphones if needed.All the zips on the Wenger Gigabyte 15,4"" black Laptop Backpack are fully lockable and the bag's back section is padded for comfort, while the straps have been designed to absorb shock.

71,"Look, chances are you have not only already heard of this popular Danish brand, who have been rocking the trendy bag scene for years now with their winning combination of form allied with robustness. Despite not being so cheap, all the more reason to compare prices for the ubiquitous original, the Kånken backpack online for the best price. Even more is the adorable mini, which is a great hard-wearing school bag for your little ones. In the middle price range you will find the rather functional Fjällräven Kånken Laptop 15 "". The notebook laptop pack offers a simple but clever compartment layout.Fjällräven Kånken Laptop 15"" - What's Up? At first sight, the now-iconic modern and practical design stands out. Particularly great is the huge colour choice of this model, with over 15 different variants to choose from. You are looking at a highly useful 18 litres of storage space contained inside: the separate, padded laptop compartment is particularly handy, obviously. Thanks to the easy-opening zip and its separation from the main compartment, you are guaranteed quick access, which I am always a fan of - rummaging is never a good time. Essentially, you can whip out the laptop on the move without lining the floor with all kinds of detritus. The tray itself is suitable for models up to 15 inches. The main compartment has a large area where you can fold in the plug, and suitable for A4 folders. Additional space is provided by 2 open side pocket and one front compartment on the front.Combines Stabilty and LightnessWith dimensions of 40 × 28 × 16 cm, the Fjällräven Kånken Laptop 15"" weighs only 460 g. This makes it a lightweight compared to its rivals in the class. Weight notwithstanding, it has a robust design: the manufacturer has used the durable vinylon F material, with the upper carrying handles and shoulder straps are padded for more comfort on longer journeys. Compared to the competition, however, the support system is still rather simple, choosing form over function, in my opinion. Unfortunately, the back strap length is a set size and is not adjustable.ConclusionOverall, if you find a cheap price online, the Fjällräven Kånken Laptop 15"" delivers exactly what you'd expect, which is excellent. The main compartment allows you to carry enough luggage for small trips, while the framed design of the proves that the design can also be incredibly functional, and not just a stylist whim. Add that to the impressive design choice, and you can find yourself an excellent travel companion."
